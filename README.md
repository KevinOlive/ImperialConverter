# ImperialConverter
Get Swifty - Part 2: Project #2 Build a US and Metric measurement converter

The project description for the homework says imperial to metric conversion and I'm assuming US measurement rather than Imperial measures as that is what US is based on but apparently has diverged from that.
This is the first project for the {Pirple} class
